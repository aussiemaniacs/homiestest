The AI engineer's work on the Kodi 21 MovieStream Pro addon was an iterative process focused on achieving core streaming functionality, specifically resolving playback issues and integrating advanced features like Cocoscrapers. Initially, the AI addressed missing client libraries, updated  and , and replaced the core  with a comprehensive version. A recurring critical issue was the  typo (), which consistently broke playback despite other fixes. The AI demonstrated persistence by providing multiple full code snippets and detailed debugging instructions, guiding the user through testing Direct Play and checking Kodi logs. The final phase involved robust error handling for client initialization and the GitHub collection, ensuring basic TMDB movie playback worked even without all advanced dependencies being installed or configured. The trajectory ends with a focus on core functionality stability, awaiting user confirmation of basic playback before fully leveraging Cocoscrapers.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a Kodi addon (), installed via ZIP or direct copy to Kodi's addons directory.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: Kodi manifest. Defines addon ID, name (), and entry point.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include dependencies for , , and  (Chat 37, 197).
-   ****: The core logic, handling navigation, menu, user input, and orchestrating client calls.
    -   **Changes**: Received extensive iterative updates (Chat 40-70, 108-111, 115-117, 122-123, 128-131, 144-145, 149-155, 162-177, 201-205, 208-225, 233-243, 249, 258).
        -   **Key Fixes**: Critical fix for  to  (lowercase 'l') (Chat 121, 163, 165).
        -   **Cocoscrapers Integration**: Comprehensive  and  functions with 4-tier priority (Cocoscrapers > M3U8 > Direct > Sample video) (Chat 50, 67, 219, 221).
        -   **Error Handling**: Improved import and client initialization robustness, especially for  and  (Chat 233, 235, 239, 241, 249, 258).
        -   **UI/UX**: Enhanced  with status indicators and a richer menu structure (, , , , ) (Chat 44, 54, 216, 217).
        -   **Debugging Tools**: Added , , ,  into the  and router (Chat 54, 223, 224).
        -   **GitHub Collection**: Improved error reporting and URL handling (Chat 125, 131).
-   ****: Defines user-configurable addon settings.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include comprehensive Cocoscrapers settings (enable, timeout, max sources, auto-play) and other Pro features (Debrid, Watchlist). Explicitly defaulted  to  and  to  (Chat 39, 44, 189, 199).
-   ****: Contains modular Python client scripts.
    -   **Changes**: Missing client libraries (, , , ) were copied from  to  (Chat 28-35).
    -   ****: Updated for robust import handling, data formatting, progress dialogs, filtering, and source resolution (Chat 28, 42, 161).
    -   ****: Enhanced for better error handling in  (Chat 125).
    -   ****: Enhanced to properly set  properties for M3U8/HLS.
    -   Other modules like , , , , , , and  are present and integrated, though their direct code changes are less detailed in the trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
-   The user still needs to fully implement the provided code by copying all specified files into their Kodi addons directory as instructed.
-   The user needs to install external Kodi dependencies like  and  for full Cocoscrapers functionality.
-   The AI is currently waiting for the user to confirm if the provided fixes for the client initialization failed error, particularly in the movies section, have resolved the issue.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report: shows a client initialization failed error when i click on popular movies (Chat 229). This indicated that despite the previous extensive work to integrate Cocoscrapers and fix playback, a core issue was preventing even basic movie listings if all Pro clients couldn't initialize.

The AI's most recent actions (Chat 230-259) were focused on making the addon more robust by decoupling basic functionalities (like listing popular movies from TMDB) from the full initialization of all advanced client modules.

Specifically, the AI:
-   Adjusted the initialization logic in  to ensure that basic clients like  and  are initialized in a fallback manner even if  is  or if some advanced clients fail to load. (Chat 233, 249, 258).
-   Modified functions like  (Chat 235),  (Chat 237),  (Chat 239), and  (Chat 241) to not strictly depend on  being  for their basic operations, allowing them to function using direct TMDB API calls or basic GitHub calls.
-   Updated  to clearly show the initialization status (Chat 243).
-   The final fix provided a replacement for the initialization part and parts of  and  in  (Chat 258), aiming to resolve the client initialization failed error for core functionalities.
The nuances of this work involve ensuring the addon provides a basic, functional experience even if optional, advanced dependencies (like Cocoscrapers) are not yet installed or fully initialized, while still being ready to leverage them when available.
