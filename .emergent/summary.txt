<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive Kodi 21 addon as requested, incrementally adding features and addressing issues. The initial phase focused on core functionality: video playback, TMDB metadata, and GitHub JSON file integration. After securing a TMDB API key, the AI developed the basic addon structure and implemented core modules. User feedback led to packaging, enhanced features like torrent/subtitle support, and extensive documentation.

A key challenge was the  when the user copied AI's instructions into the  file, which the AI promptly identified and fixed by providing a clean code version. Subsequently, the AI integrated Cocoscrapers, debrid services, TV show support, and watchlist features, creating a Pro version. The trajectory concludes with the AI providing explicit copy-paste code for the final, error-fixed files, with the  files being the last set provided, indicating where the work was left off.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a Kodi 21 addon capable of playing video links and fetching metadata, with movie information stored in editable JSON files on GitHub. The problem statement evolved into a comprehensive streaming solution.

The AI engineer developed the MovieStream Pro addon to fulfill the following requirements:
-   **Video Playback**: Support for various video formats (MP4, MKV) and streaming sources (direct URLs, YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion), with smart fallback.
-   **Metadata**: Fetch movie/TV show information (title, description, artwork, ratings, genres) primarily from TMDB API.
-   **GitHub Integration**: Read editable JSON files from a specified GitHub repository for custom movie/TV show databases.
-   **Content Types**: Support both Movies and TV Shows (with season/episode browsing).
-   **Search Functionality**: Allow searching for movies/TV shows across integrated sources.
-   **Advanced Features**:
    -   Cocoscrapers integration for finding streaming sources from multiple sites.
    -   Debrid services integration (Real-Debrid, Premiumize, All-Debrid) for premium links.
    -   Subtitle support (auto-download, multi-language, various formats).
    -   Watchlist, Favorites, and History management with resume points.
    -   Professional UI with categories, context menus, and artwork support.
    -   Tools for connection testing, cache management, and sample database generation.
The application includes a  for user configuration and  for quick setup on GitHub.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a Kodi addon designed to be installed from a ZIP file or copied directly into Kodi's addons directory. The core addon resides within a  directory.

**Directory Structure (Intended for GitHub Repository Upload):**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   ****: This is the manifest file for the Kodi addon. It defines the addon's ID (), name (), version (), provider, and dependencies. It declares  as the entry point. The most recent content is from , updated to include , , and  as optional dependencies, and reflects the Pro version features in its summary/description.
-   ****: The core Python logic for the Kodi addon. It handles navigation, displaying categories (TMDB Movies, GitHub Movies, Search, My Lists, Settings), calling various client modules for data fetching and playback, and routing actions based on user input. The latest content for this file is sourced from , an 850+ line comprehensive version that includes all features (TMDB, GitHub, Cocoscrapers, Debrid, Watchlist, TV shows) and incorporates all bug fixes.
-   ****: Defines the addon's user-configurable settings. It includes API keys (TMDB, Debrid), GitHub repository URL, playback preferences (quality, subtitles), Cocoscrapers settings (enable/disable, auto-play), UI settings, and cache management options. The most recent content is from , expanded to include over 25 settings for all new features.
-   ****: Contains the internationalization strings for the addon's UI elements, labels, and messages, allowing for easy localization. The latest content is from .
-   ** (directory)**: This directory contains modular Python scripts that encapsulate specific functionalities:
    -   ****: An empty file signifying  as a Python package.
    -   ****: Handles API calls to The Movie Database for fetching metadata. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created in Chat 26).
    -   ****: Manages fetching and parsing JSON content from GitHub. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created in Chat 26).
    -   ****: Contains logic for playing video URLs. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created/fixed in Chat 28-30).
    -   ****: Interfaces with the Cocoscrapers module to find streamable links. (Content started to be provided in Chat 214, but truncated).
    -   ****: Manages integration with Real-Debrid, Premiumize, and All-Debrid services for premium links. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created in Chat 153).
    -   ****: Handles logic specific to TV show browsing, seasons, and episodes. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created in Chat 151).
    -   ****: Manages user watchlists, favorites, and viewing history. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created/fixed in Chat 155, 202).
    -   ****: Likely handles different direct streaming source types. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created in Chat 70).
    -   ****: Manages subtitle fetching and display. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created in Chat 70).
    -   ****: Handles parsing and potentially playing torrent magnet links. (Content not explicitly provided in trajectory's final dump, but created in Chat 70).
-   ****: Contains example JSON files for movies, TV shows, featured content, and genres, demonstrating the required schema for custom content on GitHub. These are for user's initial setup.  and  have newer content from .
-   ** & **: Addon artwork displayed within Kodi. User needs to provide these or generate simple ones.

The AI created various intermediate and final versions of files (e.g., , , , ). The current state reflects that the  and  versions are the definitive ones for upload.

<pending_tasks>
-   The user needs to receive the full content of the  file, as the previous delivery was truncated.
-   The user also needs the full content of other  files (, , , , , , , , ) to fully implement the MovieStream Pro 2.0 addon.
-   The user needs to be guided on how to create  and  or default ones can be provided if the agent has the capability.
-   The full content of  and , and potentially the genre JSONs were not fully provided for copy-paste.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was providing the user with detailed, step-by-step copy-paste instructions for uploading all the necessary files for the MovieStream Pro 2.0 Kodi addon to their GitHub repository. This was in response to the user's explicit request: can you help with all necessary files and help instructions, either send to github or explain each step?.

The AI had already provided the complete code for  (using the content from ) and was in the process of providing the complete code for  (using the content from ). Due to the size of , its content was truncated in the output. Following that, the AI successfully provided the complete code for  (using the content from ).

The very last action in the trajectory was the AI stating it would provide the code for  and then starting with . However, the trajectory cuts off right after the line Create this file: , meaning the actual code for  (and all subsequent  files) has not yet been delivered to the user for copy-pasting. This is the precise point where the previous AI engineer left off.
